## Question #5
```{r Question 5, echo=FALSE}
#write more detailed description about what you did and why. 

# for question 5, I wanted to find a race that I had followed, and felt like I could provide some sort of insight. 
# after looking at the nyt reporting for a bit, I decided I wanted to see the district that Rep. Steve King was from. # King maintained his seat during the primary, but after white-nationalistic comments has been sidelined from house committee duties
# interestingly enough, King's district is IA04, and the rest of the problem set is IA03 -- wanted to the how my graphic would compare to the other district, so I included it as well. 
# important context: steve king is the only republican in the Iowan House Delegation. --> this is where I started thinking about my graphic Idea. 
# after looking at a few different variables: specifically one on reverse racisim (which wasn't asked in the IA03 data), I settled on calcuating an approval rating, and displaying it as a bar chart by age groups. 

# loaded data in from the z data frame I created in the setup chunk
